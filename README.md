# redux-router-forms
A simple React application implementing router and forms

Features:
- Uses the third-party library redux-form to handle form's state and validations/error messages.
- CRUD operations interacting with a back end Rest API, integrated into Redux's flow (action creators, actions, reducers).
- Uses Axios to perform promise-based http requests, which are then handled by a redux middleware to resolve the promises ("redux-promise").
- Follows Airbnb's React Style Guidelines to create standard code with best practices.
